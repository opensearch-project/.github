OpenSearch Project is a community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed open source search and analytics suite that makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data. Developers build with OpenSearch for use cases such as application search, log analytics, data observability, data ingestion, and more.

OpenSearch is supported by [The OpenSearch Software Foundation](https://foundation.opensearch.org/), a project of [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). You can read the launch announcement [here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-opensearch-software-foundation-to-foster-open-collaboration-in-search-and-analytics) and learn more about joining the foundation [here](https://foundation.opensearch.org/).
